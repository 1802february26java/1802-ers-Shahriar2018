 * The controller layer acts as a "glue" between the view and the business logic (the services).
 * 
 * All concrete implementations should NOT contain business logic. They should only be responsible
 * of providing users with the right view and right data when requested.
 * 
 * Recommended to have concrete implementations as singletons.
