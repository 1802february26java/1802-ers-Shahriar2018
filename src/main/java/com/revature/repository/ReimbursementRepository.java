/**
 * The ReimbursementRepository performs operations directly to the database utilizing
 * a data access library or framework, specifically on the REIMBURSEMENT, REIMBURSEMENT_STATUS,
 * REIMBURSEMENT_TYPE and in some cases, the USER table (read only for the user part).
 * 
 * For the scope of this project, there is only going to be one JDBC implementation.
 * The idea of having an interface is that in the future you might want to implement
 * it with Hibernate, Mongo, or any other data access technology.
 * 
 * It should only contain data access logic regarding to reimbursements.
